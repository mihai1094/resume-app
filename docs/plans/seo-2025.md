# SEO 2025 Game Plan

This document captures a deep-dive audit of ResumeForge’s current search posture and outlines a 2025-ready SEO roadmap. It integrates technical, content, and authority initiatives needed to compete in an aggressive “AI resume builder” SERP landscape.

## 1. Baseline Audit

| Layer | Current State | Gaps / Opportunities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Technical | Next.js App Router, custom OG images, JSON-LD (Org, WebApp, FAQ, HowTo), sitemap/robots, edge rendering. | Default domain pointed to `resume-builder.com` (now changed to `resumeforge.app`), robots lacked `host`, no Core Web Vitals telemetry/alerting, few canonical tags outside metadata helper, no hreflang or edge caching hints, missing XML feeds for blog distribution. |
| Content | Landing pages: home, editor, cover letter, terms/privacy. Blog seeded with topic clusters around ATS/AI. | No dedicated landing pages for key intents (e.g., “AI cover letter generator,” “ATS resume templates,” “job application tracker”). Blog needs fresher long-form guides tied to EEAT (case studies, expert interviews). |
| Structured Data | Org, WebApp, FAQ, HowTo already injected globally. Advanced resume schema exists. | No Article schema for blog posts, no `Product`/`Offer` markup for pricing, no `Breadcrumb` across core pages, no `VideoObject` or `HowTo` expansions for future multimedia. |
| Authority / Trust | Basic brand presence; no backlinks campaign. Privacy policy + terms exist. | Need EEAT boosters: founder bios, press mentions, customer reviews, compliance badges, SOC2/ISO messaging, transparent data handling for AI features. |

## 2. Keyword & Search Landscape (2025)

High-intent clusters (CPC > $8, rising volume):
- “ai resume builder”, “ats resume checker”, “ai cover letter generator”, “resume job matcher”

Emerging intents linked to Search Generative Experience (SGE):
- “best resume builder for [role] with ATS score”
- “cover letter AI with job tracker”
- “resume coach + AI interview prep”

SERP Features we can own:
- FAQ rich results (already partially covered; expand for new landing pages)
- HowTo / Step-by-step schema for “How to tailor resume with AI”
- Video snippets (loom-style micro tutorials) for “ATS resume tips”
- Review snippets once we collect social proof.

## 3. Strategic Pillars

1. **Technical Excellence**
   - Enforce canonical URLs + `metadata.alternates` for every route.
   - Add Web Vitals + custom metrics (`reportWebVitals` to Sentry/GTM) to align with Google’s 2025 performance weighting.
   - Expand robots/sitemap: include blog RSS, job-tracker roadmap page, status page, and new landing pages as they launch.
   - Add server-side `X-Robots-Tag` policies for preview/utility routes (e.g., `/preview`, `/perf-test`).
   - Implement HTTP security headers via `proxy.ts` (done) and add `Link rel=preconnect` for analytics/CDN endpoints.

2. **Experience + EEAT**
   - Launch “Team & Advisors” page showcasing resume experts, hiring managers, and methodology.
   - Collect testimonials/ratings, then integrate `SoftwareApplication` `aggregateRating` with real data.
   - Publish transparent AI explainability statement (models, data sources, privacy).
   - Add author bios on blog posts + structured `Person` schema referencing LinkedIn/Twitter.

3. **Content & Landing Pages**
   - Build dedicated funnels:
     - `/ai-resume-builder` (feature deep-dive + comparison table)
     - `/ats-resume-checker`
     - `/ai-cover-letter-generator`
     - `/job-application-tracker`
     - `/resume-examples/[role]` programmatic hub (e.g., software-engineer, product-manager)
   - Each page includes: hero, proof, FAQs, CTA, internal links to editor, structured data, comparison vs competitors.
   - Expand blog clusters:
     - **AI Resume Playbooks**: prompts, case studies, optimization workflows.
     - **ATS Science**: real recruiter interviews, breakdown of top ATS systems.
     - **Career OS**: job tracker habits, follow-up templates, networking automation.
   - Create downloadable assets (checklists, templates) to earn backlinks and collect leads.

4. **Programmatic + User-Generated Signals**
   - Programmatic SERP pages for “Resume + [Company]” that show tailored keyword suggestions (generate 50–100 high-intent pages with dynamic metadata).
   - Encourage users to publish shareable resume links (“Powered by ResumeForge”) for referral/backlinks.
   - Build review capture flow (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot) and surface aggregated stats site-wide.

5. **Offsite & Partnerships**
   - Target bootcamps, career coaches, and HR influencers for co-created content/backlinks.
   - Sponsor resume challenges / hackathons.
   - Launch referral program with unique landing pages tracked for SEO + SEM synergy.

## 5. Content Roadmap

| Sprint 4 | Programmatic “Resume Examples” library (10 starter roles) + internal linking to editor | Long-tail acquisition + conversions. |

## 6. Measurement & Reporting

- **KPIs**: Organic signups, free-to-pro conversions, top 20 keyword rankings, share of voice vs. Zety/Resume.io/TealHQ, Core Web Vitals (LCP <2.5s, INP <200ms).
- **Dashboards**: GA4 (SGE queries, conversions), GSC (coverage, enhancements), Sentry (vitals), Looker Studio board combining product + marketing data.
- **Cadence**: Weekly technical checks, monthly content/authority review, quarterly roadmap updates.

## 7. Immediate Action Items (Next 2 Weeks)

1. ✅ Fix base domain references + robots host (completed in this PR).
2. Add canonical + metadata audit script to ensure every route sets `alternates`.
3. Implement `Article` JSON-LD in blog components.
4. Ship `/ai-resume-builder` + `/ats-resume-checker` landing pages (reuse home hero, add proof).
5. Stand up `reportWebVitals` hook (send to Sentry + console until backend ready).
6. Draft content calendar + assign authors, with review workflow for EEAT (bios, credentials).

This plan keeps ResumeForge competitive against aggressively funded rivals by pairing technical precision with differentiated content and trust-building signals tailored to Emerging Search (SGE) realities in 2025. Let's revisit quarterly and adjust based on SERP movement and feature launches.***
