# Lint and Fix

Run linting on the codebase and fix any issues.

## Steps

1. Run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues
2. Analyze the output and categorize issues by severity
3. Fix auto-fixable issues where appropriate
4. Report remaining issues that need manual attention

Prioritize fixing errors over warnings, and explain any patterns of issues found.
