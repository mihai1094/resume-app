# Build and Verify

Run the production build and type-check the project.

## Steps

1. Run `npm run build` to create a production build
2. Report any build errors or warnings
3. If successful, confirm the build passed

Focus on identifying and explaining any TypeScript errors, build failures, or warnings that need attention.
